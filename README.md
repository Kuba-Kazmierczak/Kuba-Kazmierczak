### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Recently I decided that I want to change my professional career to IT. I have been preparingfor this for some time after completing the
Infoshare Academy course. I am currently learning and improving my web developer skills as a self-taught Java-related tech with the help
of Udemy and more experienced colleauges . I deeply believe that my perseverance will help me achieve this goal.
